- Email account for sending notifications

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd Poly-Agent
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

5. Start the application:
```bash
./start
```

This script will start the Django server, React development server, and Celery workers.

### Integrated User Interface

Poly-Agent features an integrated user interface that combines:

1. **React-based GitHub analysis tools** - For exploring organization members and repositories
2. **Django-based health monitoring system** - For tracking website and service health

Both systems are seamlessly integrated into a single user interface, allowing you to:

1. Navigate between GitHub data and health checks from the main navigation
2. Access health monitoring features from the "Health Monitoring" menu item
3. Create and manage health checks for your services
4. View uptime reports and performance metrics

### Health Checks

Poly-Agent includes a comprehensive health checking system that allows you to:

1. Create health checks for your services with customizable ping intervals
2. Monitor response times and receive alerts when they exceed thresholds
3. Get email notifications when services are down
4. Generate uptime and performance reports

To use the health checks feature:
1. Access the checks dashboard at the "Health Monitoring" section
2. Create a new check and configure its parameters
3. Use the provided ping URL in your service to notify Poly-Agent it's running
4. Set up notification preferences

**Starting the health checks background tasks:**
```bash
# Start Celery worker and beat for health checks
./register_checks_tasks.sh
```
